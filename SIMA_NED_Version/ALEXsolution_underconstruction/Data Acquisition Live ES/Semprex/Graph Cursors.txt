                                            Locking the X-axis and Y-axis on a Graph, So That Cursors Can't Scroll
                                            beyond the Edge of the Graph Display 

                                            Product Group: LabVIEW Software

                                            Product Name: LV-ALL

                                            (Ver / Rev.): 3.1

                                            Problem: Is it possible to lock the x-axis and y-axis on a Graph, so that a user can't scroll the cursor
                                            beyond the set range of the axes.

                                            Solution: Yes. To enable this, add the following line to the LabVIEW.ini file: scrollGraphCursors=False

                                            If you wish to do this in an application (this requires LabVIEW 5.0 or higher plus the Application Builder
                                            add-on), then you will need to distribute an .ini file with your application that is a duplicate of the labview.ini
                                            file from your LabVIEW directory, with a few changes: The .ini file should have the same name as the
                                            top-level VI and you must change the first line from "[LabVIEW]" to the same name as your VI. 

                                            For example, if your top-level VI is called "MyApp.vi", then your .ini file should be "MyApp.ini" and the first
                                            line in the file should be "[MyApp]". This will ensure that your application has the same settings as your
                                            original VI. For more information, see the LabVIEW Application Builder Troubleshooting Wizard.
